# BoxStacking
This repo attempts to implement several algorithms to stack 3D boxes in a container in a way that maximizes the amount of boxes able to be stored in the container. Currently, the only in progress method to solve this problem in this repo is with NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies), but other algorithms may be tested depending on the efficacy of this method.
